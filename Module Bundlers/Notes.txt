Webpack, Rollup, Parcel and Snowpack 

    Module Bundlers 

        - take multiple js file and compile it to a single js file 
        - so in our example we installed the lodash package
        - then we created js file and html file and linked to it 
        - after that, when we tried to access the lodash from the js file it wasn't importing because it doesn't know where to find it  

         index.js file 
         
            import {camelCase} from 'lodash';
            console.log(camelCase('hello world'));


        - This is where web pack comes in 
        - first we install it using 
            - npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

        - then we edit the scipt of json file 
                "build" : "webpack" 
            - then we run npm  run build 

        - remember that webpack looks for the index.js file
