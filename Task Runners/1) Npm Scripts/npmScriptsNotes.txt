Script are found inside a json file that will run commands 

    normally it is 

        "scripts" : {

            "test" : "some gibberish"
        }

    we can customize it to run custom orders like if we want to run a file by the command "start" 

        "scripts": {

            "start": "node index.js"
        },

        //so here if we type npm start, it will run index.js file
